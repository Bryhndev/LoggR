Hello and thank you for checking out my software! 
It is a really really simple thing, it's just an easy, super simple way of logging activities. 
I made this software to simplify and remove annoying aspects of my own work - formatting and correctly timestamp 
my patient's interactions and actions through the night, as i am a night shift worker working with a very sick, dangerous 
individual. This software is designed to automatically format every single entry in real time and, at the end of my shift, 
at the press of a button, copy everything so it's immediately ready to paste right into the journaling software we use at work
for our patients. 

All it offers: instead of writing every single detail, like timestamp, format with dashes and colon (for timestamping), you simply write what happened (i.e my patient smokes, so i write "smokes").
The software, once i'm ready to put everything in at the end of my shift, copies the entire content and formats it perfectly for our browser-based journaling program.
it simplifies work to stone-age level so i can save my fingers all the annoying formatting.

Offers an easy log keeping archive as well so you can check earlier logs, sorted by date. Since i work with sensitive data, i also made it so that every single complete log i make gets irrevokably
deleted and is unable to be recovered. It's an option given as you want to exit the software and is entirely optional and prompts you before closing.

Currently only in Norwegian but i'm adding a command that can be written in-software to translate/change language to English.

Quite useless for anyone who seeks anything other than timestamping and uniformly formatting log-work.
